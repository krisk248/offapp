# Offline Youtube App

This is a Next.js application designed to be an "Offline Youtube App". While the exact features are not fully defined by the project structure alone, the file names suggest capabilities related to video handling, potentially downloading or processing videos for offline viewing, and interacting with some form of AI (possibly for summarization, transcription, or other video analysis).

## Features

Based on the project structure and file names, the application likely includes:

- **Video Handling:** Components like `src/components/video-card.tsx` and `src/components/video-grid.tsx` suggest displaying video content.
- **Download Functionality:** The presence of `src/components/download-panel.tsx` strongly indicates features related to downloading videos.
- **User Interface:** Built with Next.js, React, and styled with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui components.
- **State Management:** Utilizing React Context API (`src/store/app-context.tsx`).
- **AI Integration:** Files in the `src/ai` directory point towards integration with AI models, possibly via Genkit.
- **Utility Functions:** Common helper functions in `src/lib/utils.ts`.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js:** React framework for server-side rendering and routing.
- **React:** JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript:** Typed superset of JavaScript.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
